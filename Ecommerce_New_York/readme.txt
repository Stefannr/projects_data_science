We were given a fake and cleaned dataset of an Ecommerce company based in New York where we should help them decide whether they should invest in an app or website. The goal of this project is to build and train the linear regression model, so the instructor asked some questions throughout the project that I noted in my jupyter notebook code.

Numerical columns in dataset:

Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
